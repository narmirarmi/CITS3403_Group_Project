## About Project

This is a voting website where users can upload images of products and receive votes from other users to see if they should purchase an item or not.
The first page user will see is a Login/Signup page. After loggin in, they will land in their home page Where they can see what others have posted. For desktop users, there will be multiple images in one page but for mobile users they will see one image at a time and they can swipe up to see more. Each image will contain like, dislike, comment and username.

On top right side of the screen, user can see their profile picture. Click / tap will show their account where they can see their details, as well as logout and Delete Account.

At the bottom of the page, they will have their Home page button on Left side and Profile on right side. Click on profile to see their profile picture on top, and all the uploaded images with the liked percentage on each image. They can click / tap on the images to openit. Under the photo, they can see how many likes and diskiles that image has received. Also a delete icon.
